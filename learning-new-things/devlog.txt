Devlog #1... 03/24/2025

What are we learning this week? The building blocks of HTML (and maybe responsive HTML too?).

Ideas:
- A blog for posting this kind of content (devlogs and stuff), with images and code snippets too.

What do we need?

- Navbar (website header)
- Main pane (article)
- Sidebar (document overview)
- Footer (website footer)

Let's try it out :)

What did I learn?

1) Some HTML elements lend themselves nicely to page layouts.
- Use elements like <nav> to store a set of links.
- <article> defines self-contained content.

2) You can expand the height of an element using vh units (viewport height). 1vh = 1% of viewport height.

3) Remember, when passing props to a React component, keep them inside a single object, like so:
function MyComponent({props}) { ... }

4) You can define CSS variables using the --varname: value notation, and then var(--varname) in other CSS code.
5) To remove the bullet points on a ul, use `list-style-type: none`.

Great work! This was a really fun hour and it was hard putting it down.

Next steps:
- Functioning links to different sections of the article
- Adding more images
- Maybe change the color scheme? (Not a huge fan... look on Pinterest for inspo).

Cheers! Looking forward to the next one.
