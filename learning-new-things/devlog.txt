Devlog #2...03/26/25

Switching it up from the BlogPage idea right now. Maybe I'll add more to that later,
but I want to get even more fundamental than that. Woohoo!

What are we learning today?
- Some state-based components (flipcards)
- maybe some element interactions (hover, click, etc)
- some key UI elements in HTML (see article)

Let's try it out :)

Flipcards:
- basic idea: card with generic background, click to "flip" and reveal score 1-10.
		- toggleable (flip again to revert)

Next Steps:
- Flipcards and layouts (grid, flex, etc.)
- HTML UI elements and layouts (same as above?)
- Look into Chakra UI and Material UI for open-source components!
